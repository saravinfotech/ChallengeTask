# Updates done 
-	SlowNetwork.kt --> 
    - Uncommented the codes 40-42 & 49-51 which were commented to disable the main thread execution. 
    - Now this file is back to the original state preventing these methods to be called from Main thread
-	CountryViewModel.kt--> 
    - Uses MutableLiveData to post the values to the UI
-	getCountriesFromFile() function parses the JSON from SlowNetwork on IO thread using coroutines
-	CountryDetail --> ü§¶ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇ‚Äç added the @SerializedName annotation for the JSON keys
-	As of now haven‚Äôt integrated the logic to fetch specific country name and country capital. Working on the same, will refactor the class names and variables
-	Updated the code in ViewModel to use Kotlin filter function to fetch the specific country name based on Country Code. As of now the country code is hardcoded to DEN
-	Updated the code to fetch the country capital. Still the country name is hardcoded.
-	Handled the crash occurring due to entry of country name which was not in the list.


## Enhancements that can be done
-	Progress bar until the text is loaded
-	Disable Button if nothing entered
-	Disable the button once the user clicks the button or click enter button
-	Enter action to be handled. 
-	Allow edit text to accept only alphabets

### Alternate Option
- Loopers & message queue's could have been used, but I haven's used loopers post the availability of inbuilt Async Tasks, Coroutines.
- If my understanding is right loopers and Message queue's would be an ideal choice when more control is required over the thread execution.
