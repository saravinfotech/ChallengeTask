Updates done 
-	SlowNetwork.kt --> 
-- Uncommented the codes 40-42 & 49-51 which were commented to disable the main thread execution. 
-- Now this file is back to the original state preventing these methods to be called from Main thread
•	CountryViewModel.kt--> 
o	Uses MutableLiveData to post the values to the UI
•	getCountriesFromFile() function parses the JSON from SlowNetwork on IO thread using coroutines
•	CountryDetail --> 🤦🤦‍♂‍ added the @SerializedName annotation for the JSON keys
•	As of now haven’t integrated the logic to fetch specific country name and country capital. Working on the same, will refactor the class names and variables
•	Updated the code in ViewModel to use Kotlin filter function to fetch the specific country name based on Country Code. As of now the country code is hardcoded to DEN
•	Updated the code to fetch the country capital. Still the country name is hardcoded.
•	Handled the crash occurring due to entry of country name which was not in the list.


Enhancements that can be done
•	Progress bar until the text is loaded
•	Disable Button if nothing entered
•	Disable the button once the user clicks the button or click enter button
•	Enter action to be handled. 
•	Allow edit text to accept only alphabets
